Common examples include <code>screen navigation</code>, <code>in-app browser</code> and <code>etc</code>.</p><p>To implement these functionalities, each <code>WebView</code> project typically needs to establish its own communication interface. Conversely, there are times in a React Native app when features from the web need to be invoked.</p><p>Since WebView and the web operate as distinct entities, communication is usually implemented in a unidirectional manner.</p><p>However, <code>rnbridge</code> transcends this limitation by utilizing event and promise-based mechanisms, enabling bidirectional communication. This approach allows for the retrieval of return values from functions as one would in a standard programming context.</p>',8),r=[o];function s(c,d,l,p,h,m){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const u=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{w as __pageData,u as default};
